Ground 0; I came in peace

#I'm working on a modified "object detection"; currently struggling to get Anaconda, OpenCV and Tensorflow along! in a project that can:
#1- Detect "correctly" fractures of certain bones on X-rays
#2- using knonw "clinical classifications" of these fractures; I want to know whether deeplearning can add something new!
